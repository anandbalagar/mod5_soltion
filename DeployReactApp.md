# Deploying React Applications to Azure Static Web Apps: BrowserRouter and HashRouter

## Introduction

Deploying a React application to Azure Static Web Apps requires careful consideration of routing strategies, especially when using client-side routing with React Router. In this article, we'll explore the deployment process for React applications on Azure Static Web Apps, covering both `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter` scenarios.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the deployment process, make sure you have the following:

- A React application (create one using `create-react-app` if you don't have an existing project).
- An Azure account with access to the Azure portal.

## Deploying with BrowserRouter

### 1. Configure Server to Handle Client-Side Routing

Azure Static Web Apps use a serverless architecture, and by default, they are optimized for single-page applications (SPAs) with client-side routing. However, to use `BrowserRouter`, ensure that your server is configured to handle client-side routing by redirecting all requests to the `index.html` file.

### 2. Update Your Azure Configuration

In your Azure Static Web App configuration, make sure to set up the necessary routes and redirects. Navigate to the Azure portal, find your Static Web App, and configure the "Routes" section to include a catch-all route that directs all requests to the root `index.html`. This ensures that your React application is loaded for any route.

### 3. Deploy to Azure

Deploy your React application to Azure Static Web Apps. This can be done through the Azure portal or by connecting your repository directly to Azure. Ensure that your build script is correctly configured to generate the necessary artifacts.

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, test your application by navigating to different routes directly. If you're using `BrowserRouter`, you should be able to access routes like `example.com/react/route`. If the routes work as expected, congratulations, you've successfully deployed a React app using `BrowserRouter` on Azure Static Web Apps.

## Deploying with HashRouter

### 1. Update React Router Configuration

If you decide to switch to `HashRouter` for deployment on Azure Static Web Apps, update your React Router configuration to use `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter`.

```jsx
// Change BrowserRouter to HashRouter
import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

// Your route definitions remain the same
```

### 2. Deploy to Azure

Deploy your updated React application with `HashRouter` to Azure Static Web Apps using the same deployment process mentioned earlier.

### 3. Test Your Application

After deployment, test your application again, this time using routes with hash fragments, such as `example.com/#/react/route`. Verify that client-side routing is working as expected.

# Conclusion

Deploying a React application to Azure Static Web Apps involves ensuring that your chosen client-side routing strategy aligns with the server configuration. Whether you opt for `BrowserRouter` or `HashRouter` depends on your application's requirements and the server environment.

By following the steps outlined in this article, you should be well-equipped to deploy your React application to Azure Static Web Apps successfully. Remember to choose the routing strategy that best fits your needs and aligns with the capabilities of Azure Static Web Apps.

Happy coding and deploying!
